close()  closes  a  file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any
       file and may be reused.  Any record locks (see fcntl(2))  held  on  the
       file  it was associated with, and owned by the process, are removed re‚Äê
       gardless of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock.  This
       has some unfortunate consequences and one should be extra careful  when
       using  advisory  record  locking.   See  fcntl(2) for discussion of the
       risks and consequences as well as for  the  (probably  preferred)  open
       file description locks.
